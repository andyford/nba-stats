# NBA Stats #

Uses the [xmlstats](https://erikberg.com/api) API by [Erik Berg](https://erikberg.com/).

If you want to fork this repo, make sure you get an API key from xmlstats and setup your config.js file accordingly (I've included an example config.example.js file). *Don't publish your API key in a public repo!*
